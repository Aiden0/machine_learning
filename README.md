# How to view
You can view my notebooks in the machine learning notebook folder.
You can view the Python notebook by either opening it up in Github, but I highly recommend openning it up in 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ instead. Then you can interactive with the notebooks.


# For Docker
If you want to run the notebooks for some reason yourself you can use the docker container
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
