# Machine Learning
This is a folder filled with Jupyter notebooks of common machine learning techniques with examples. The table of contents are down below:

## Table of contents

* Kernal density estimates
* Mixture models?
* Clustering (Meanshift,Kmean)
* Dimensionality Reduction (PCA,LDA,)
* Nerual networks


# How to view
You can view my notebooks in the machine learning notebook folder.
You can view the Python notebook by either opening it up in Github, but I highly recommend openning it up in 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ instead. Then you can interactive with the notebooks.


# For Docker
If you want to run the notebooks for some reason yourself you can use the docker container
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
